 * In order to structure the scripts in a reasonable way,

 * http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/
 *
 * "Certain actions cause the browsing context to navigate to a new resource.
 * A user agent may provide various ways for the user to explicitly cause a
 * browsing context to navigate, in addition to those defined in this specification"
 *
 * 1) In the context of a web application a navigation could map to a "Page" which leads to
 * using the page object pattern.

 *
 * 2) In the context of Apps (Android/iOS) the navigation would map to a screen and screen object
